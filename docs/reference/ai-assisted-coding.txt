                              Doesn’t Mean Higher Velocity

                              Engineers report coding 3–5x faster with AI assistants, yet many teams find
                              their sprint velocities haven’t budged. The bottleneck has simply moved —
                              and understanding where it went is critical for getting real productivity
                              gains.

                              How is Software Built?




                                                             A simplistic view of making software products



                              This is a very simplistic view of making a feature or a new product, reality is
                              always much more messy. Most of these steps don’t happen such neatly and
                              linearly (for good reasons). And you keep doing this in repeat to make more
                              and more complex pieces of products.




                                                        A more realistic view of software development life cycle



                              Let’s take a more deeper look into implementation since that’s where we see
                              most popular AI assistants focusing.

                                                             The implementation phase (simplistic view)



                              You write code and tests, you test them and iterate on the code and when you
                              are happy with the outcome, you send them for peer reviews. In this pipeline
                              your bottlenecks are primarily writing code and tests. Peer reviews and local
                              testing can also become bottlenecks given the criticality of the code paths,
                              team culture and size of the change (10 lines of a change is much easier to
                              review than 200 lines of a change) and development environment support.


                              Peer review is a dual purpose role — they help you ensure quality, both short and
                              long term. And they help spread the knowledge about a change — you are not
                              alone anymore, someone else understands the change.

                              What is (Gen) AI Changing?
                              In the past couple of years there have been a deluge of AI tools across this
                              workflow with most success and adoption in the implementation phase. If
                              you don’t believe me, think of the 3 most known AI assistants in this
                              workflow — Claude Code, Cursor and Github Copilot. They all are focused
                              primarily on the implementation part of the workflow.


                              What makes this different from previous automation tools? Unlike code
                              generators or scaffolding tools that handled boilerplate, modern AI
                              assistants generate complete, context-aware implementations — entire
                              functions, classes, or features. The scope and sophistication of what they
                              produce fundamentally changes the developer’s role from writer to reviewer-
                              editor.


                              With AI assistants, most of the code is written by AI, in minutes, but the
                              engineer “implementing” is still the one responsible for the code being
                              written. This changes the implementation dynamics drastically.




                                                              Implementation with AI coding assistants



                              The New Bottlenecks


                              The bottleneck shifts from writing code and unit tests to understanding code, local
                              testing, and self/peer reviews.

                                                                         The new bottlenecks



                              As AI generates more and more code and unit tests, the bottleneck shifts
                              from “writing” code and unit tests to local testing, and self/peer reviews.
                              Remember the role of “code review” — both holding quality bar and
                              spreading knowledge. Given the human “implementer” is still the one
                              responsible for the code generated, they now have to spend as much, if not
                              more, time as the peer reviewer reading and understanding the code being
                              generated.

                              Compounding this challenge, in most cases, given the quality limitations of
                              today’s AI coding agents, especially related to generating maintainable code,
                              this potentially also means the engineer needs to change the generated code
                              either by hand or by further prompting.


                                 AI Coding Agents: Code Quality
                                 Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code
                                 that humans can understand. —…

                              Understanding AI-generated code is fundamentally different from reviewing
                              code you wrote yourself. When you write code, you’ve already reasoned
                              through the logic, considered edge cases, and built a mental model. With AI-
                              generated code, you’re reverse-engineering someone else’s (or something
                              else’s) solution — which can take considerably longer than writing it yourself
                              would have taken.


                              The Knowledge Transfer Problem gets worse, not better. In traditional code
                              review, the author deeply understands their changes and the reviewer learns
                              from them. With AI-generated code, both author and reviewer are
                              simultaneously learning what the code does, effectively doubling the
                              cognitive load and time required.

                              10 lines of code = 10 review feedback. 500 lines of code = LGTM


                              A long time before CI/CD was a popular thing, 2 decades ago I worked on a
                              software that was shipped every 6 months. Even back then, our team had a
                              code review policy of sending back any “large” change. When humans wrote
                              all the code, this was easy to follow since we tend to build things in smaller
                              logical chunks most of the time instead of building one large feature in one
                              go.


                              Even with AI agents, you can go “generate just this one method”, then
                              another prompt for “add usages of this” etc. If you go to that granularity, then
                              it’s just a bit more work with the great AI autocompletes to write your own
                              code and you lose out on most of the potential of generating code faster.


                              The challenge is that review time doesn’t scale linearly — it scales
                              exponentially with change size. A 500-line review doesn’t take 5x longer than
                              a 100-line review; it can take 10–15x longer as reviewers must hold
                              increasingly complex context in their heads and trace interactions across
                              many changes.


                              Full disclosure: recognizing this problem led us to build an agent that helps
                              you split the large changes AI agents generate, group them into logical
                              chunks to make it easier to review/send it for peer reviews. Additionally it
                              provides granular annotation of each change to make it easier to understand
                              the changes (beyond the summaries your AI coding agent of choice
                              generated). The agent is open source and you get to provide the models you
                              prefer (from Claude and OpenAI to open source models like Qwen Coder).

                              What This Means for Teams?
                              To actually achieve higher velocity with AI coding assistants, teams need to
                              adapt their workflows:


                              1. Prompt for smaller, logical changes: Rather than asking AI to “implement
                              the entire feature,” break requests into reviewable chunks — single
                              functions, focused refactors, or specific behaviors.


                              2. Invest in review tooling: Tools that help understand, annotate, and split
                              AI-generated changes become as critical as the generation tools themselves.

                              3. Treat AI code like external contributions: Apply the same scrutiny you’d
                              give to code from a junior developer or external contributor — assume
                              nothing about correctness or maintainability.


                              4. Pair programming with AI: Have one developer prompt the AI while
                              another reviews in real-time, catching issues before they compound.


                              The next generation of AI coding tools must prioritize reviewability and
                              understandability, not just generation speed. Until they do, faster code
                              generation will continue to create slower code review — leaving overall
                              velocity unchanged.
